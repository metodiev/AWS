# 1.1 IAM Users

##  What is an IAM User?
An **IAM User** is a digital identity in AWS that represents a person or an application.  
It is used to authenticate and interact with AWS services.

- **Human users** → Developers, admins, operators  
- **Programmatic users** → Applications, CI/CD pipelines, automation scripts  

Each user has:
- **Credentials** (username/password for console, access keys for APIs/CLI/SDKs)
- **Permissions** (granted via IAM policies)


## Learning Objectives
- Understand the role of IAM users in AWS security
- Learn how to create and manage IAM users
- Assign policies and permissions properly
- Use IAM best practices to avoid security risks


##  Hands-on Lab: Creating an IAM User

### Step 1: Open IAM
- Go to the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)

### Step 2: Create a New User
- Click **Users → Add User**
- Enter **username** (e.g., `dev-user`)
- Select **Access Type**:
  -  Programmatic Access (for CLI/SDK access)
  -  AWS Management Console Access (for UI access)

### Step 3: Assign Permissions
- Attach existing policies (e.g., `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`)
- OR create a group with defined permissions (recommended)

### Step 4: Review and Create
- Download credentials file (`.csv`) for safekeeping
- Login URL is provided for console access


##  CLI Example: Create IAM User

```bash
# Create a new IAM user
aws iam create-user --user-name dev-user

# Attach policy (read-only access to S3)
aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --user-name dev-user \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess

# Create access keys (for CLI/SDK use)
aws iam create-access-key --user-name dev-user

```

Best Practices for IAM Users
Use IAM Roles instead of users for EC2, Lambda, or services (users are for humans).
Least privilege principle → Assign only necessary permissions.
Groups over direct policies → Easier to manage at scale.
MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) → Require MFA for all human IAM users.
Rotate credentials regularly → Use AWS Secrets Manager or IAM Access Analyzer.
Audit IAM activity with CloudTrail and IAM Access Advisor.

## Exercise

- Create a user app-deployer with programmatic access only.

 - Attach AmazonEC2FullAccess and AmazonS3FullAccess policies.

- Generate access keys and configure AWS CLI using:

```bash
aws configure
```
Test by creating an S3 bucket with that user’s credentials.
