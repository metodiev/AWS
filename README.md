# AWS Grandmaster Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a **AWS Mastery Journey**.  
It expands layer by layer, like a skill tree — from **foundations** to **grandmaster projects**.



##  Phase 1 – Core Foundations 
- **IAM**: users, roles, policies, SCPs  
- **Compute**: EC2, AMIs, Auto Scaling  
- **Storage**: S3, EBS, EFS, lifecycle policies  
- **Networking**: VPC, subnets, security groups, NACLs  
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, CloudTrail  
- *Hands-on*: Build a secure 3-tier web app  



## Phase 2 – Professional Architectures 
- High availability and disaster recovery  
- Multi-region VPC design  
- Route 53, CloudFront, Global Accelerator  
- Cost optimization strategies  
- Well-Architected Framework deep dive  
- *Goal*: Solutions Architect Professional  



## Phase 3 – DevOps and Automation 
- IaC: CloudFormation, CDK, Terraform  
- CI/CD: CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions  
- Containers: ECS, EKS, Fargate  
- Observability: X-Ray, OpenTelemetry  
- *Hands-on*: Full CI/CD pipeline for microservices  



## Phase 4 – Serverless Architectures 
- Lambda tuning and orchestration  
- API Gateway, Step Functions  
- EventBridge, SQS, SNS, Kinesis  
- *Hands-on*: Uber-like backend with serverless stack  



## Phase 5 – Data and AI
- Data lakes: S3, Glue, Athena, LakeFormation  
- Redshift performance tuning  
- EMR and Spark clusters on AWS  
- Kinesis for real-time analytics  
- SageMaker ML training and deployment  
- *Goal*: AWS Data Analytics Specialty  



##  Phase 6 – Security and Governance 
- IAM deep dive (cross-account, federation)  
- Encryption (KMS, CloudHSM, Nitro Enclaves)  
- Security Hub, GuardDuty, Macie  
- Compliance: HIPAA, PCI, FedRAMP  
- AWS Organizations and multi-account strategy  
- *Goal*: AWS Security Specialty  



##  Phase 7 – Edge and IoT
- IoT Core, Greengrass, FreeRTOS  
- Hybrid cloud: Snowball, Snowmobile, Outposts  
- Edge compute: Wavelength and Local Zones  
- *Hands-on*: Industrial IoT project  



##  Phase 8 – Industry Architectures 
- **FinTech**: QLDB, fraud detection pipelines  
- **Healthcare**: FHIR APIs, HIPAA-ready storage  
- **Gaming**: GameLift, matchmaking, scaling  
- **Media**: IVS, Transcoder, CDN optimization  
- **Government**: Air-gapped regions  



##  Phase 9 – Cutting-Edge AWS 
- Quantum computing: Amazon Braket  
- Robotics: AWS RoboMaker  
- Space data: Ground Station  
- Sustainability: Graviton, carbon footprint APIs  
- AI-powered infrastructure (AIOps)  



##  Phase 10 – Grandmaster Projects 
- Build global SaaS multi-tenant platform  
- Chaos engineering: simulate data center outage  
- AI-driven cost optimization engine  
- Contribute open-source AWS SDK/Terraform modules  
- Teach and mentor: AWS Hero, re:Invent speaker  



##  End Goal
- Multi-specialty mastery (Architect, DevOps, Data, Security, IoT)  
- Ability to **design AWS at Amazon’s scale**  
- Recognition as a thought leader (books, talks, whitepapers)
