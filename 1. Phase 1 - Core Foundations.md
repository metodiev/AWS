# AWS Grandmaster Roadmap – Phase 1: Core Foundations

Welcome to **Phase 1** of the AWS Grandmaster Roadmap!  
This phase builds the **essential foundations** every AWS practitioner must master before advancing to professional and specialized tracks.  
Think of it as your **"AWS bootcamp"** — covering identity, compute, storage, networking, and monitoring.



##  Phase 1 Learning Goals

- Understand **IAM** (users, roles, policies, SCPs) for access control
- Launch and manage **EC2 instances**, AMIs, and Auto Scaling
- Explore AWS **storage options**: S3, EBS, EFS, lifecycle policies
- Build secure networks with **VPCs, subnets, security groups, NACLs**
- Monitor and audit with **CloudWatch and CloudTrail**
- Apply these skills in a **hands-on project** (secure 3-tier web app)



##  Topics & Study Path

### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Users vs Roles
- Policies & JSON syntax
- Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations

### 2. Compute (EC2)
- Launching EC2 instances
- Creating & using Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
- Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) and launch templates

### 3. Storage
- S3 basics (buckets, objects, versioning)
- EBS volumes & snapshots
- EFS for shared storage
- Lifecycle policies for cost optimization

### 4. Networking
- VPC, CIDR blocks, subnets
- Security Groups vs NACLs
- Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways, route tables
- Private vs Public subnets

### 5. Monitoring & Logging
- CloudWatch metrics, dashboards, alarms
- CloudTrail for audit logging



## Hands-on Project: Secure 3-Tier Web App

**Goal:** Build a simple but production-ready **3-tier architecture** in AWS.  

### Architecture:
1. **Frontend:** Public subnet, EC2 instance with Nginx serving static content
2. **App Layer:** Private subnet, EC2 running backend app (Node.js/Java/.NET)
3. **Database:** RDS instance in private subnet
4. **Networking:** Security groups restricting traffic (only frontend → app → DB)
5. **Monitoring:** CloudWatch metrics & CloudTrail enabled

### Deliverables:
- Terraform/CloudFormation templates for reproducibility
- Documentation of IAM roles & policies
- Architecture diagram (draw.io / Lucidchart / text-based)
